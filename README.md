Before I start, I want to give the audience a clarification. This app isn't 100% translate into ASL signing...they are merely fingerspelling with an existed alphabet. Also, I am an authentic deaf person. I thought this project would be a good introduction for the hearing audience, such as colleagues, friends, or something to start the small conversation. Hopefully, that would lead to disassemble the communication barriers between hearing and deaf people. Especially for my field (web development), where it is a high percentage of hearing people/workers. At one point, I hope this app would pull them in and start the conversation.
